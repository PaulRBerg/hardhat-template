A Hardhat-based template for developing Solidity smart contracts, with sensible defaults.

- [Hardhat](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat): compile, run and test smart contracts
- [TypeChain](https://github.com/ethereum-ts/TypeChain): generate TypeScript bindings for smart contracts
- [Ethers](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/): renowned Ethereum library and wallet implementation
- [Solhint](https://github.com/protofire/solhint): code linter
- [Solcover](https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage): code coverage
- [Prettier Plugin Solidity](https://github.com/prettier-solidity/prettier-plugin-solidity): code formatter

## Getting Started

Click the [`Use this template`](https://github.com/paulrberg/hardhat-template/generate) button at the top of the page to
create a new repository with this repo as the initial state.

## Features

This template builds upon the frameworks and libraries mentioned above, so for details about their specific features,
please consult their respective documentations.

For example, for Hardhat, you can refer to the [Hardhat Tutorial](https://hardhat.org/tutorial) and the
[Hardhat Docs](https://hardhat.org/docs). You might be in particular interested in reading the
[Testing Contracts](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/testing-contracts) section.

### Sensible Defaults

This template comes with sensible default configurations in the following files:

```text
├── .editorconfig
├── .eslintignore
├── .eslintrc.yml
├── .gitignore
├── .prettierignore
├── .prettierrc.yml
├── .solcover.js
├── .solhint.json
└── hardhat.config.ts
```

### VSCode Integration

This template is IDE agnostic, but for the best user experience, you may want to use it in VSCode alongside Nomic
Foundation's [Solidity extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NomicFoundation.hardhat-solidity).

### GitHub Actions

This template comes with GitHub Actions pre-configured. Your contracts will be linted and tested on every push and pull
request made to the `main` branch.

Note though that to make this work, you must use your `INFURA_API_KEY` and your `MNEMONIC` as GitHub secrets.

For more information on how to set up GitHub secrets, check out the
[docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).

You can edit the CI script in [.github/workflows/ci.yml](./.github/workflows/ci.yml).

## Usage

### Pre Requisites

First, you need to install the dependencies:

```sh
bun install
```

Then, you need to set up all the required
[Hardhat Configuration Variables](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/configuration-variables). You might
also want to install some that are optional.

To assist with the setup process, run `bunx hardhat vars setup`. To set a particular value, such as a BIP-39 mnemonic
variable, execute this:

```sh
bunx hardhat vars set MNEMONIC
? Enter value: ‣ here is where your twelve words mnemonic should be put my friend
```

If you do not already have a mnemonic, you can generate one using this [website](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/).

### Compile

Compile the smart contracts with Hardhat:

```sh
bun run compile
```

### TypeChain

Compile the smart contracts and generate TypeChain bindings:

```sh
bun run typechain
```

### Test

Run the tests with Hardhat:

```sh
bun run test
```

### Lint Solidity

Lint the Solidity code:

```sh
bun run lint:sol
```

### Lint TypeScript

Lint the TypeScript code:

```sh
bun run lint:ts
```

### Coverage

Generate the code coverage report:

```sh
bun run coverage
```

### Report Gas

See the gas usage per unit test and average gas per method call:

```sh
REPORT_GAS=true bun run test
```

### Clean

Delete the smart contract artifacts, the coverage reports and the Hardhat cache:

```sh
bun run clean
```

### Deploy

Deploy the contracts to Hardhat Network:

```sh
bun run deploy:contracts
```

### Tasks

#### Deploy Lock

Deploy a new instance of the Lock contract via a task:

```sh
bun run task:deployLock --unlock 100 --value 0.1
```

### Syntax Highlighting

If you use VSCode, you can get Solidity syntax highlighting with the
[hardhat-solidity](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NomicFoundation.hardhat-solidity) extension.

## Using GitPod

[GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) is an open-source developer platform for remote development.

To view the coverage report generated by `bun run coverage`, just click `Go Live` from the status bar to turn the server
on/off.

## Local development with Ganache

### Install Ganache

```sh
npm i -g ganache
```

### Run a Development Blockchain

```sh
ganache -s test
```

> The `-s test` passes a seed to the local chain and makes it deterministic

Make sure to set the mnemonic in your `.env` file to that of the instance running with Ganache.
